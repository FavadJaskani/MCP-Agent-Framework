# MCP-Agent-Framework
What is MCP?
MCP (Multi-agent Communication Protocol) is a flexible framework for building autonomous AI agents that can communicate, coordinate, and collaborate to solve complex tasks. By standardizing agent communication and providing modular tools and protocols, MCP makes it easy to create specialized agents that work together effectively.
Why MCP?
As AI systems become more complex, there's a growing need for frameworks that enable multiple AI agents to work together. MCP addresses this need by providing:

Standardized Communication: A common language for agents to exchange information and coordinate actions
Modular Architecture: Create specialized agents for different tasks that can be combined as needed
Extensible Framework: Easily add new capabilities through custom tools and protocols
Flexible Integration: Works with any LLM provider and can be integrated with existing systems

Key Features

🧩 Modular Agent Architecture: Easily create specialized agents with different capabilities
🗣️ Flexible Communication Protocol: Standardized message format enabling seamless inter-agent communication
🛠️ Tool Integration: Extend agent capabilities with custom tools
📋 Coordination Mechanisms: Built-in planning and execution protocols
🧠 Memory Systems: Short and long-term memory for agents
📈 Scalable: From simple single-agent applications to complex multi-agent systems

Use Cases

🔍 Research Assistants: Gather, analyze, and synthesize information from multiple sources
💻 Code Generation: Design, implement, and test software applications
📊 Data Analysis: Process and visualize data with specialized agent workflows
🎓 Educational Systems: Create personalized learning experiences with multiple teaching agents
🤖 Automation: Build complex workflows using multiple specialized agents

Getting Started
Installation
bashpip install mcp-agent
Quick Example
pythonfrom mcp.core.agent import Agent
from mcp.core.coordinator import Coordinator
from mcp.protocols.planning import PlanningProtocol
from mcp.tools.web_search import WebSearchTool

# Create agents with different capabilities
research_agent = Agent(
    name="researcher",
    tools=[WebSearchTool()],
    description="Performs web research on topics"
)

planner_agent = Agent(
    name="planner",
    protocols=[PlanningProtocol()],
    description="Creates and coordinates execution plans"
)

# Create a coordinator to manage the agents
coordinator = Coordinator([research_agent, planner_agent])

# Execute a task
result = coordinator.execute_task("Research recent developments in AI and create a summary report")
print(result)
