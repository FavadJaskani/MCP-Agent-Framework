# Agent Design Guide

This document provides guidelines for designing effective agents using the MCP framework.

## Agent Architecture

Each agent in MCP consists of the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Identity**: Unique name and ID for the agent
2. **Description**: The agent's capabilities and purpose
3. **Protocols**: Communication protocols the agent implements
4. **Tools**: Action capabilities available to the agent
5. **Model**: The underlying LLM powering the agent
6. **Memory**: Storage for past interactions and knowledge

### Design Principles

When designing agents, follow these principles:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should excel at a specific task or domain
2. **Clear Communication**: Agents should generate clear, structured messages
3. **Composability**: Agents should work well with other agents
4. **Explainability**: Agent decisions should be traceable and understandable
5. **Failure Handling**: Agents should gracefully handle errors and edge cases

## Specialized Agent Types

### Planner Agents

Planner agents specialize in:
- Task decomposition
- Step sequencing
- Resource allocation
- Goal refinement

Key design considerations:
- Include the PlanningProtocol
- Prioritize reasoning capabilities
- Consider including a MemoryTool for context awareness

### Executor Agents

Executor agents focus on:
- Following plans
- Coordinating between agents
- Tracking progress
- Handling failures

Key design considerations:
- Include the ExecutionProtocol
- Access to relevant tools for tasks
- Strong error handling capabilities

### Research Agents

Research agents excel at:
- Information gathering
- Knowledge synthesis
- Fact verification
- Data analysis

Key design considerations:
- Include tools like WebSearchTool
- Bias minimization strategies
- Citation and source tracking

### Memory Agents

Memory agents specialize in:
- Knowledge storage
- Information retrieval
- Pattern recognition
- Context management

Key design considerations:
- Include tools like MemoryTool
- Implement efficient retrieval mechanisms
- Balance between recall and relevance

## Implementation Best Practices

1. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Craft clear, concise agent descriptions
   - Provide examples of expected behavior
   - Include constraints and guidelines

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Only provide tools relevant to the agent's purpose
   - Ensure tools have clear error handling
   - Document tool usage patterns

3. **Protocol Selection**
   - Choose protocols that match interaction patterns
   - Combine complementary protocols
   - Create custom protocols for specialized needs

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize unnecessary message passing
   - Cache frequent interactions
   - Use efficient memory storage

5. **Testing**
   - Test individual agent capabilities
   - Test agent interactions
   - Simulate edge cases and failures
